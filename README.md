### Introduction to Emotion Detection Project

Understanding emotions is a crucial part of human interaction, whether it's in personal relationships or customer service. For this project, I’m excited to create an emotion detection system that analyzes facial expressions in images to identify different feelings like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutrality.

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with keras, my goal is to build a model that learns to recognize these emotions by examining facial features in images. I plan to use well-known datasets, such as FER-2013 or AffectNet, to train the model and see how accurately it can identify emotions from real-life photos.

Ultimately, I want this project to pave the way for applications in areas like mental health support, interactive technologies, and social media analysis. By making emotion detection more accessible, I hope to enhance how we understand and respond to human emotions in various settings.
